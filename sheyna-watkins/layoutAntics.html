              <p><span class="p__lead-in">There</span> were once a man and a
                woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the
                woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people
                had a little window at the back of their house from which a
                splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most
                beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a
                high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged
                to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all
                the world.</p>

              <p class="p--indent">One day the woman was standing by this window
                and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was
                planted with the most beautiful rampion &mdash; rapunzel, and
                it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the
                greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day,
                and as she knew thatnshe could not get any of it, she quite pined
                away, and began to look pale and miserable.</p>

              <p class="p--indent">Then her husband was alarmed, and asked,
                what ails you, dear wife. Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some
                of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall
                die. The man, who loved her, thought, sooner than let your wife
                die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what
                it will. At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the
                garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion,
                and took it to his wife. </p>

              <p class="p--extraTopPadding">
                <span class="p__lead-in p__lead-in--hangingIndent">
                She at once made</span> herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.
                It tasted so good to her &mdash; so very good, that the next day
                she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have
                any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In
                the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again. But
                when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for
                he saw the enchantress standing before him.</p>

              <p class="p--indent">How can you dare, said she with angry look,
                descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief. You
                shall suffer for it. Ah, answered he, let mercy take the place
                of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.
                My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing
                for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.</p>

              <p class="p--indent">Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be
                softened, and said to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow
                you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make
                one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will
                bring into the world. It shall be well treated, and I will care
                for it like a mother. The man in his terror consented to everything,
                and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at
                once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with
                her.</p>

              <p class="p--extraTopPadding">
                <span class="p__lead-in p__lead-in--hangingIndent">
                Rapunzel grew</span> into the most beautiful child under the sun.
                When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a
                tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door,
                but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress
                wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,
                "Rapunzel, Rapunzel," let down your hair to me.</p>

              <p class="p--indent">Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as
                spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she
                unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks
                of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down,
                and the enchantress climbed up by it.</p>
