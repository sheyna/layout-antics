###A Project for Code Fellows Foundations 2: UX/UI

I used Skeleton to create a grid of columns while I used Flex Box to align the background image rows. However as the background images mostly have no content there was nothing to push them down the page and I had to rely on "flex-basis" to to push the boxes down the page. But if the page was resized the text box would flow past the footer. I added a media query as a quick fix to this problem.

Additionally, Skeleton's code interferes with the background-clip I used on the h1 tag. I went ahead and removed all of that code from the page.
